Construct a Hero object and then create one of each of the dragons and
place them in an ArrayList of Dragons. Allow the user to choose which dragon to attack and
then allow the user to choose to attack with an arrow or with a sword. Do that much damage to
the dragon they chose to attack. If the user defeats a dragon, then remove it from the ArrayList.
Randomly select a (living) dragon to attack the user, then randomly choose the type of attack it
will do (basic or special attack). Repeat this process until the user defeats all three dragons, or
until the user is knocked out.
